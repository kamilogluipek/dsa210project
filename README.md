Weather and Social Media time

Hypothesis: When the weather is rainy, cloudy and snowy my social media screen time increases.

Methods:
Data gathering: I'll gather the weather and my social media data (instagram) from 17/02/2025 till 17/04/2025 and compare them using charts and descriptive statistics. I'll be mainly using python, pandas and matplotlib libraries.
