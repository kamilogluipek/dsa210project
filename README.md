# DSA210project
# Introduction
The aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between my social media time and weather status between the dates 17/02/2025 and 17/04/2025.

# Hypothesis 
When the weather is rainy, cloudy and snowy my social media screen time increases. I am confident that when weather is subjectively bad and it's harder to go out and socialize I tend to spend more time on instagram.

# Motivation
I realized that my screen time is increasing significantly and I want to monitor and control my activity. I believe that my findings can help me to reduce my social media time and help me do something more productive instead by gaining awareness on my behaviour.

# Data source
I'll gather the weather and my social media data (instagram) from compare them using charts and descriptive statistics. I believe I won't have any problems with ethics and privacy issues since all weather data is publicly avaible and my own data won't be that personal. Including the weather data, I'll only focus on if it's raining, cloudy or snowy, not on moisture, pressure or rain/snow amount or alike parameters.

# Project Plan 
1. Gather all the data needed.
2. Modify the data so it can be edited and be ready to analyze.
3. Provide graphs and descriptive statistics using pandas and matplotlib libraries.
4. Test the hypothesis using p-test and analyzing the charts.
5. Determine wheter the hypothesis is correct or not, if it's not try to explain why.
